# Synapse UI: Styling Guidelines

## 1. Core Philosophy

The visual identity of Synapse UI is built on a simple principle: **maximum customizability through a consistent API**. We do not ship a pre-compiled CSS file that users have to override. Instead, we provide components whose styles are a collection of utility classes. The final, optimized CSS file is generated by the end-user's own build process, ensuring it's minimal, performant, and perfectly tailored to their project.

This approach keeps our components lightweight and prevents the style conflicts and bloat that are common with traditional UI libraries.

## 2. The Styling Stack

Our visual language is powered by two core technologies:
* **Tailwind CSS v4**: The utility-first engine for all visual styling.
* **`tailwind-variants`**: The library for managing and defining all component style variations.

## 3. The Component Styling Pattern

Every component with visual variations is built using a two-file system: a **Vue component file** and a corresponding **variants file**. This separation of concerns is the key to our architecture.

* **The Variants File (`variants.ts`)**: This file is the single source of truth for a component's appearance. It acts as a "style dictionary" that defines all possible looks for that component. It contains a **base set of styles** that apply to all versions of the component, along with named **variants** for different styles (like `variant`, `size`, or `color`). It can also define **compound variants**, which are special styles that apply only when a specific combination of variants is active, allowing for sophisticated, context-aware styling.

* **The Component File (`Component.vue`)**: The Vue component itself is kept clean and simple. Its only styling-related job is to import the "style dictionary" from its variants file. The component's props are derived directly from the variant names, creating a clean, type-safe, and predictable API. Based on the props it receives, the component simply applies the corresponding collection of utility classes from its dictionary.

This pattern ensures that a component's logic is cleanly separated from its presentation, making both easier to maintain and extend.

## 4. Design Tokens & Theming Strategy

To ensure `Synapse UI` components are effortlessly themeable, all styles must use **semantic color names** (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `card-background`).

These semantic names will be defined in the library's `tailwind.config.js` file and mapped to CSS variables. This creates a centralized theming contract. The primary benefit of this system is for the end-user: by overriding a small set of CSS variables in their own project, they can apply their unique brand's color palette across every `Synapse UI` component instantly. This provides deep and consistent theming capabilities without needing to alter the component code itself.

## 5. Naming Conventions for Variants

To create a consistent API across all `Synapse UI` components, variant props should be named according to the following conventions:

* **`variant`**: Use for the primary stylistic appearance of a component (e.g., `default`, `outline`, `glass`).
* **`size`**: Use for sizing variations (e.g., `sm`, `default`, `lg`).
* **`color`** or **`intent`**: Use for semantic color variations (e.g., `primary`, `destructive`, `success`).
* Use **boolean props** for simple on/off states that have a clear visual impact (e.g., `disabled`, `interactive`).
