# Phase 1: Laying the Foundation

**Objective:** To establish the core technical infrastructure and validate the development workflow. This phase is about building the "factory" before we start manufacturing the components. The goal is to create a stable, efficient, and enjoyable development environment that aligns with the project's vision and technical standards.

The successful completion of this phase will be marked by the existence of a single, perfectly structured, and fully functional **Button** component. This button will serve as the proof-of-concept for our entire architectural model.

## Key Initiatives (The "What")

### 1. **Project Scaffolding & Toolchain Integration**
   - **Intent:** To create the initial project structure and integrate all the essential development tools defined in the `VISION.md` and `SYNAPSE_RULEKIT.md`. This is the bedrock of our entire development process.
   - **Key Dependencies to Install & Configure:**
     - **Framework:** Vue 3 + TypeScript
     - **Build System:** Vite (configured for Library Mode)
     - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 & `tailwind-variants`
     - **Animation:** GSAP
     - **Headless Primitives:** Reka UI
     - **Testing:** Vitest
     - **Documentation Workshop:** Histoire
     - **CLI Foundation:** Commander.js

### 2. **Establish the Directory Structure**
   - **Intent:** To create the physical folder layout as specified in the `SYNAPSE_RULEKIT.md`. A clean, predictable structure is crucial for scalability and maintainability. This ensures every piece of code has a logical and consistent home.

### 3. **Configure the Core Styling & Theming Contract**
   - **Intent:** To set up the `tailwind.config.js` file with our initial set of semantic design tokens (e.g., `primary`, `destructive`). This establishes the theming API that end-users will leverage, fulfilling a core promise of the library.

### 4. **Build the Foundational "Button" Component**
   - **Intent:** To implement the first component to validate every aspect of our chosen architecture. The Button is not just a UI element; it is the test case for our entire development workflow.
   - **Process:**
     - Create `Button.vue` using the `<script setup>` syntax.
     - Define its visual styles in a corresponding `variants.ts` file.
     - Write unit tests in `Button.spec.ts` to ensure its logic is sound.
     - Create an interactive `Button.story.vue` to develop and document it in Histoire.

### 5. **Validate the End-to-End Development Loop**
   - **Intent:** To confirm that all our tools and processes work together seamlessly. A smooth developer experience is a key differentiator for Synapse UI.
   - **Success Criteria (Commands from `SYNAPSE_RULEKIT.md`):**
     - Can we run `pnpm run dev` to see and interact with the Button in Histoire?
     - Can we run `pnpm run test` and see the Button's tests pass successfully?
     - Can we run `pnpm run build` and get a clean, production-ready library bundle?

**Outcome:** At the end of this phase, we will have a fully configured, tested, and documented "template" for all future components. This foundational work will allow us to accelerate the development of more complex components and patterns in subsequent phases.
